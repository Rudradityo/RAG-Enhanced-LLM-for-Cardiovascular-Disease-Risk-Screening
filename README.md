This dissertation aims to design and develop an LLM based Cardiovascular Disease Risk Screening
Application enhanced with RAG, coupled with FastAPI, and Streamlit. The application predicts the
severity of cardiovascular disease risk by analyzing patient case data, which encompasses age,
height, weight, gender, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose levels, smoking
and alcohol consumption habits, and physical activity levels. The application also displays relevant
information.
