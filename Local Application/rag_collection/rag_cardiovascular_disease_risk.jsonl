{"association": "Effect of Age on Cardiovascular Disease Risk", "content": "With every pump of our heart, blood courses through our arteries and veins, carrying oxygen and nutrients through our body. But as we age, blood vessels can stiffen, blockages can build up, and the system may become prone to inflammation, resulting in increased risk of heart attacks, heart failure, and other cardiac dysfunction.", "source": "https://medicine.tufts.edu/news-events/news/what-happens-our-cardiovascular-system-we-age"}

{"association": "Effect of Height on Cardiovascular Disease Risk", "content": "In both sexes, the prevalence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and ischemic stroke was higher among patients of smaller body height. In contrast, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism was higher in taller patients.", "source": "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9647991/"}

{"association": "Effect of Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure on Cardiovascular Disease Risk", "content": "For CVD subtypes, both systolic and diastolic BP were most strongly associated with coronary artery disease, and least strongly associated with atrial fibrillation, as well as being positively associated with ischaemic stroke and heart failure.", "source": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00895-2"}
{"association": "Effect of Cholesterol Level on Cardiovascular Disease Risk", "content": "With high cholesterol, you can develop fatty deposits in your blood vessels. Eventually, these deposits grow, making it difficult for enough blood to flow through your arteries. Sometimes, those deposits can break suddenly and form a clot that causes a heart attack or stroke.", "source": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800"}
{"association": "Effect of Glucose Level on Cardiovascular Disease Risk", "content": "Having diabetes increases your chance of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Over time, high blood sugar levels from diabetes can damage the blood vessels in your heart, making them more likely to develop fatty deposits.", "source": "https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/your-heart/diabetes-and-heart-disease"}
{"association": "Effect of Smoking on Cardiovascular Disease Risk", "content": "Smoking is a major cause of heart and blood vessel disease. The coronary arteries supply the heart with oxygen and nutrients. Over time, fatty deposits ( plaque ) can build up inside the coronary arteries . This can reduce the flow of blood to the heart and increases the risk of heart attack. Smoking speeds up the clogging and narrowing of coronary arteries.", "source": "https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/smoking-and-heart-disease"}
